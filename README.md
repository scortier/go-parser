directory structure for your JSON parser project in Golang:

```
json-parser/
|-- lexer/
|   |-- lexer.go
|-- parser/
|   |-- parser.go
|-- builder/
|   |-- builder.go
|-- main.go
|-- go.mod
|-- go.sum
```

Let's briefly describe the purpose of each directory and file:

json-parser/: Root directory of your project.

This directory contains the entire project.
lexer/: Directory for the lexical analysis part.

lexer.go: Implementation of the lexer.
parser/: Directory for the syntactic analysis (parser) part.

parser.go: Implementation of the parser.
builder/: Directory for building JSON objects.

builder.go: Implementation of the object builder.
main.go: Main entry point of your application.

This is where you can invoke the JSON parsing functionality.
go.mod and go.sum: Files for managing Go modules.

These files help manage the project's dependencies.

# Let's delve into the design approach for each major component of the JSON parser project: lexer, parser, and builder.

1. Lexer (Tokenization):
   Design Approach:
   Define Token Types:

Enumerate the different types of tokens in JSON (e.g., string, number, boolean, null, object start, object end, array start, array end, comma, colon).
Lexer Structure:

Create a lexer structure that takes an input string and produces a stream of tokens.
Use a state machine or regular expressions to match and identify token patterns.
Token Structure:

Define a Token structure with fields like Type (enumeration) and Value (actual value of the token).

2. Parser (Syntactic Analysis):
   Design Approach:
   Define Grammar Rules:

Enumerate the grammar rules for JSON.
Describe the hierarchical structure and relationships between different elements.
Parser Structure:

Create a parser structure that takes a stream of tokens and produces an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
Implement recursive descent parsing or another parsing technique based on the defined grammar.
AST Structure:

Define a set of AST node types representing different elements of the JSON structure.
Each node should have a type, value, and children (sub-nodes).

3. Builder (Constructing Golang Objects):
   Design Approach:
   Traverse AST:
   Create a function that traverses the AST and converts it into corresponding Golang objects.

4. Main Entry Point:
   Design Approach:
   Integrate Lexer, Parser, and Builder:
   Create a main entry point that orchestrates the entire process: tokenization, parsing, and building JSON objects.
